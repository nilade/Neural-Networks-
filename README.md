1) The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine.  The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.    Problem statement: predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.   2)  PREDICT THE BURNED AREA OF FOREST FIRES WITH NEURAL NETWORKS
